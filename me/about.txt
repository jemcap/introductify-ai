Studied at nottingham trent university where I graduated with a bachelors in Product Design, and had the great opportunity to lead the website team for a yearly-ran student-led initiative called the NTUDI in my final year in 2022, where, we designed a platform to showcase final year product design student work to industry leaders and enthusiasts. After my tenure, I realised that Web was the avenue I wanted to get into so I made a courage decision to switch careers. I have a couple of commercial experience as well as voluntary, and pro bono work as a Developer , gaining hands-on experience with various tools and frameworks, mainly with React. Although, I’m still at the birth of my journey. I’m always eager to learn and excited for technological advancements which pushes me to refine my skills and explore new tools. I also run a side business in Sports Media. Although, it’s not directly related to development. I do believe it strongly translates. This field of work compliments my creative endeavours, allows me to think outside of the box in a fast-paced environment, and most importantly understanding user requirements and user empathy.
